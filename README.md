# Robot Kinematics Simulation

The goal of this program is to provide a simple and visual way to represent the kinematics of a robot.
This software uses Pygame to display and control the different aspect of this simulation

to get the frames position of the robot the software uses the DH method to solve the direct kinematics problem
